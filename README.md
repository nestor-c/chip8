# chip8
Chip 8 C++ emulator

This is my implementation of the chip 8 project to start getting a sense of emulators. 
From this project I hope to move on to more advanced versions like that of a NES emulator.

What I've learned building this project:

I familiarized myself with configuring a project to use static libraries. 

I delved deep into different compiler types used based on OSX or Windows operating systems and familiarized myself with a few more
options available to the linker and compiler such as -I for pointing the compiler to include directories -L for naming the library used and -g 
used to add debugging symbols to the compiled executable.

I then moved on to learning the cmake build system and learned to compile a basic program. Learned to accomplish the same compilation
I was doing with the GNU C++ compiler and Clang compiler. 

In debugging the program I gained familiarity with the address sanitizer.
